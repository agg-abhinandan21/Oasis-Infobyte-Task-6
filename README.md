🍷 Task-6: Wine Quality Prediction – Oasis Infobyte Internship 📊

As part of my Oasis Infobyte Data Science & Machine Learning Internship, I completed Task-6, which involved predicting the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using Machine Learning classification techniques.

📌 Project Overview:

The goal was to analyze a Wine Quality Dataset containing parameters such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, sugar levels, and more, to predict whether a wine is of good or bad quality.

🛠 Steps Involved:

🔹 Data Understanding & Cleaning – Checked for missing values, ensured data consistency, and examined feature distributions.
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized feature relationships with wine quality using heatmaps, pair plots, and boxplots.
🔹 Feature Engineering – Normalized data for better model performance.
🔹 Model Building – Applied classification models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
🔹 Model Evaluation – Used accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for performance assessment.
🔹 Insights – Identified the most influential factors affecting wine quality, such as alcohol percentage and volatile acidity.

💡 Outcome:

Successfully built and evaluated models that can predict wine quality with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for winemaking, quality control, and the beverage industry.
